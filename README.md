# Air Quality Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction
The **Air Quality Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to visualize and analyze air pollution levels across various locations. It provides insights into air quality metrics such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and other pollutants, enabling users to track pollution trends and assess environmental conditions.

## Objective
The primary objective of this dashboard is to:
- Monitor air quality levels across different regions.
- Identify trends and patterns in pollution levels.
- Provide actionable insights for policymakers, environmentalists, and the general public.
- Enhance awareness of air pollution and its impact on health.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: View air quality trends through dynamic charts and graphs.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Map-based insights to identify pollution hotspots.
- **Time-Series Trends**: Analyze pollution variations over time.
- **Pollutant Comparisons**: Compare different air pollutants across locations.
- **Filter and Drill-down Capabilities**: Customize data views based on regions, time periods, and pollutant types.

## Data Sources
The dashboard is built using data collected from reliable sources such as:
- Government air quality monitoring agencies
- Open-source air pollution datasets
- Environmental research organizations

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For calculations and data modeling.
- **Excel/CSV**: For data preprocessing and integration.

## How to Use
1. Download and open the **.pbix** file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Navigate through the different pages of the dashboard.
3. Use filters to customize the data view based on time, location, and pollutants.
4. Interact with charts to drill down into specific details.
